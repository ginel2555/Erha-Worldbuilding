# The Legacy of the Wanderlords

## Historical Background
One hundred years ago, the Shadow Work organization established the title of Wanderlord in response to growing threats from illegal magic and an increasingly hostile wildlife. This position was designed to create a protector unbound by conventional restrictions while maintaining control through magical safeguards.

## The Wanderlord's Role
- **Purpose**: Protection of common people from magical and bestial threats
- **Authority**: Unrestricted freedom to act in defense of the populace
- **Limitations**: Magical binding via bloodoath to prevent misuse of power

## Current Era
The Fourth Wanderlord, Ardrun of Imanu, has served for 25 years as the realm's protector. His tenure marks a significant period in the history of the position, now culminating in the current tournament event known as The Herding.
